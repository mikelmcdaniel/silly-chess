## Silly Chess!

Note: This was for a class I was teaching. This isn't a serious project. ;)

It's chess but with less rules.

- Pawns don't move 2 spaces on their first turn
- Pawns can't promote/change to other pieces when the get to the end of the board
- No castling: King cannot swap with a Rook
- No check or checkmate

There may be some new rules added later.
